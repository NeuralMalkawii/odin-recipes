    <p>fresh pasta at home
        It’s super fun to make together, and it only requires a handful of basic ingredients. Of course, the fact that it’s
        absolutely delicious doesn’t hurt either. 🙂

    <h3>How to Make Pasta</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>make a nest with the flour on a clean work surface</li>
        <li>use your hands to gently mix in the flour.</li>
        <li>knead! At the beginning, the dough should feel pretty dry, but stick with it! It might not feel like it’s going to come
        together, but after 8-10 minutes of kneading, it should become cohesive and smooth:</li>
        <li>shape it into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>slice it into 4 pieces</li>
        <li>Use a rolling pin or your hands to gently flatten one into an oval disk.</li>
        <li>run it through the widest setting of your pasta maker</li>
        <li>Once you’ve folded the dough, roll it out to your desired thickness.</li>
    </ol>
